# Fetch Rewards Coding Exercise - Data Engineer
This challenge will focus on the similarity between two texts. Your objective is to write a program that takes as inputs two texts and uses a metric to determine how similar they are. Documents that are exactly the same should get a score of 1, and documents that donâ€™t have any words in common should get a score of 0.
